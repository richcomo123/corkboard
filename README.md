For college students living on campus or involved in clubs on campus. 
Who needs a convenient way to spread information about issues or campus activities. 
The Cork Board is a website that creates a collaborative environment where people can view and add things to a digital CorkBoard. 
Unlike Niner Destination, Cork Board allows people to search, add, and Create Cork Boards. 
Forums would be integrated into the Cork Board System allowing people to have short dialogues. 
By bringing a staple of the college campus to a digital medium we now allow a greater audience to access on campus activities.
